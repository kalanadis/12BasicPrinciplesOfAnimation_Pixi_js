# The Illusion of Life (of a Box)

In 1981 Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas of Disney animation introduced a recipe to  give life to illustrations.
- Squash and Stretch
- Anticipation
- Staging
- Straight Ahead Action and Pose to Pose
- Follow Through and Overlapping Action
- Slow In and Slow Out
- Arc
- Secondary Action
- Timing
- Exaggeration
- Solid drawing
- Appeal

As Game Developers we can use these principles to make juicy animations.
This is a simple demo I did using [Pixi js](http://www.pixijs.com/)
